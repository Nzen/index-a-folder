## Index a folder ##

There are a number of tools in this space. [dir2html](https://www.arclab.com/en/dir2html/index.html) has lots of polish, but I remembered that I don't need a canned solution when I can make one myself. Put a copy in the folder you want to index. Run with the command line or double click on it. Open the index file in a browser.
